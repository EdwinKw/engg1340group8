**Project idea:
2. Commodity inventory system (Marco)
 
**Problem statement:

Issue statement:
Using traditional methods (paper & manpower) to manage stock information is expensive, inefficient, unreliable. Using software system can remedy these disabilities of traditional methods.

Vision:
Software system can provide sustainability and reliability. The status or information of the commodities would be clearly stated(by method of graphs or statistical data). The managers of the shops can make decision easily, accurately and also to speed up working process.

Method:
To solve the problem, the system will include the following elements: file input and output, sorting data records, searching data records, adding data records, editing data records and deleting data records.  

In practical, the program is expected to adopt filters to search for commodity, append new commodity data, delete obsolete commodity data , update commodity data, which prompts a better inventory management.  Also, inventory status will alerts when it is nearly “out-of-stock” or when it is currently “out-of-stock” in order to prevent a short in commodity.

**Problem setting:
With an increasing demand in renowned bands, an inventory with inventory with abundant commodity is crucial.  To meet thw target, a reliable, efficient and multifunctioning inventory system is needed.  Under the control and management of the system, profit can be maximized and unwanted waste, say, exceed stock, can be reduced.  To meet the demand, a commodity inventory system is being developed.

**Exctra program feature(s):
The program will predict the amount of the commodities next week(or a few days later) by algorithms. If the amount predicted is below zero, a warning will be given and the function will suggest an amount of commodities needed for the coming week.  This further prevents a short in commodity and even prevents a specific commodities overwhelming.
